# 16-bit-animations

A simple 16-bit assembly program (for DOS) that calculates the salary of 10 employees having 4-digit salaries and implements a typing animation for the title and a color animation for the result.

## How can one run this program?

While it might be tempting to directly run the `main.exe` file on Windows to see the program run, this program was originally designed for 16-bit systems (specifically DOS) and modern Windows variants are mainly built in 32/64-bit systems and most do not have backward compatibility for 16-bit legacy programs. So a 16-bit system or environment such as DOSBox setup most likely would be required to run this program.
